![Artifacts Available](https://img.shields.io/badge/Artifacts-Available-2da44e?style=flat&labelColor=2b2b2b) ![Artifacts Functional](https://img.shields.io/badge/Artifacts-Functional-007ec6?style=flat&labelColor=2b2b2b) ![Results Reproduced](https://img.shields.io/badge/Results-Reproduced-fe7d37?style=flat&labelColor=2b2b2b)

A complete toolkit for research artifact evaluation with guides, templates, and evaluation forms for computer science conferences.

## Overview

This repository provides complete resources for artifact evaluation, originally developed for [ToSC (Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology)](https://tosc.iacr.org/index.php/ToSC/artifact_evaluation) but applicable across computer science venues.

**Why use artifact evaluation?** It increases research impact through improved reproducibility, provides quality recognition through badges, ensures permanent archival, and helps the community build upon your contributions.

**What's included:**

- Step by step guides for authors and reviewers
- Professional templates and checklists
- Practical examples with real tools and workflows
- Standardized evaluation forms and badge system
- Best practices with copy pastable code snippets

## Quick Start

Choose your path based on your role in the artifact evaluation process.

### For Authors

Prepare and submit artifacts for evaluation:

1. **Start here:** [`authorguide.md`](authorguide.md) - Complete preparation guidance and workflows
2. **Template:** [`readmetemplate.md`](readmetemplate.md) - Professional README structure for your artifact
3. **Enhancement:** [`bestpractices.md`](bestpractices.md) - Advanced tips with practical examples
4. **Verification:** [`authorchecklist.md`](authorchecklist.md) - Final review checklist before submission

### For Reviewers

Evaluate artifacts systematically and fairly:

1. **Process:** [`reviewerguide.md`](reviewerguide.md) - Evaluation criteria and step by step process
2. **Documentation:** [`reviewerform.md`](reviewerform.md) - Standardized form for consistent reporting

### For Conference Organizers

Implement artifact evaluation at your venue:

- Adapt guides and forms to your conference's specific requirements
- Use the badge system for consistent artifact recognition
- Reference evaluation criteria for reviewer training

## Badge System

Standardized recognition system for evaluated artifacts.

**Three-tier certification:**

- ![Available](https://img.shields.io/badge/Artifacts-Available-2da44e?style=flat&labelColor=2b2b2b): Publicly retrievable via stable link (DOI optional but recommended)
- ![Functional](https://img.shields.io/badge/Artifacts-Functional-007ec6?style=flat&labelColor=2b2b2b): Works as described with good documentation and completeness
- ![Reproduced](https://img.shields.io/badge/Results-Reproduced-fe7d37?style=flat&labelColor=2b2b2b): Main results independently verified

**Implementation:** See [`bestpractices.md`](bestpractices.md#badges-and-presentation) for badge usage examples and embedding code.

## Getting Started

**New to artifact evaluation?** Start with [`reviewerguide.md`](reviewerguide.md) for evaluation guidance.

**Need to prepare an artifact?** Use [`authorguide.md`](authorguide.md) for preparation workflows.

**Want quick templates?** Use [`readmetemplate.md`](readmetemplate.md) and [`authorchecklist.md`](authorchecklist.md).

**Want advanced techniques?** Explore [`bestpractices.md`](bestpractices.md) for presentation tips.
